::: {#hero-heading}

# Welcome!

I am a Lecturer in Political Science (Research Methods) at the [University of Melbourne](https://arts.unimelb.edu.au/school-of-social-and-political-sciences). Before, I held positions at the Goethe [University in Frankfurt am Main](https://www.goethe-university-frankfurt.de/en?locale=en), Germany, and the [Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) Institute](https://www.v-dem.net/) in Gothenburg, Sweden. I am Principal Investigator and Project Leader of the DFG-funded project on [Smart Authoritarianism?](projects/index.qmd) Comparing the Internet Strategies of Authoritarian Regimes. 

My research interests are:

- Democracy, authoritarianism, regime change
- Political communication, Internet politics
- Quantitative methods

I am co-founder of [QuantLab](https:quantilab.github.io).
