::: {#hero-heading}

# Welcome!

I am a Senior Lecturer in Political Science (Research Methods) at the [University of Melbourne](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/1051597-seraphine-maerz) and an Australian Research Council DECRA Senior Fellow. Before, I held positions as Assistant Professor at the [Goethe University](https://www.goethe-university-frankfurt.de/en?locale=en) in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and the [Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) Institute](https://www.v-dem.net/) in Gothenburg, Sweden. The different sections of this website provide an overview of my [publications](publications/index.qmd), [research projects](projects/index.qmd), [datasets](datasets/index.qmd), and [teaching experience](teaching/index.qmd). You find [my CV here](cv/index.qmd). 

My research interests are:

- Democracy, authoritarianism, autocratization
- Political communication, authoritarian informationalism
- Quantitative and computational methods, large language models (LLMs)

I am co-founder of [QuantLab](https://quantilab.github.io), a new network group aiming
to bring together social scientists at the University of Melbourne and beyond to
share insights in cutting-edge quantitative methods and research. I offer online workshops on how to use [LLMs as research tools](https://instats.org/expert/seraphine-maerz-2?view=Seminars). Check out our new [quallmer R package](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/) - an easy-to-use toolbox for qualitative researchers to quickly apply LLMs to code and analyze their data.
