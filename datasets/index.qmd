## ShinyApps and interactive dashboards to explore our datasets

I think ShinyApps and dashboards are great tools to explore and
interactively work with new datasets which is why we developed the
following applications along with our datasets:

-   The [TOSCO ShinyDashboard](https://tosco.shinyapps.io/data/) (put together with the TOSCO team)
    provides data on ownership of Internet service providers (ISPs) and
    several applications to explore these ownership structures and state
    control over ISPs.

-   The [ERT ShinyApp](https://episodes.shinyapps.io/validation/)
    (put together with Sebastian Hellmeier) provides several interactive
    applications allowing users to flexibly adjust the parameters of the ERT
    dataset (see below) and test their validity.

## Episodes of Regime Transformation (ERT)

Identifies episodes of democratization (liberalizing autocracy, democratic
deepening) and autocratization (democratic regression, autocratic
regression) in the most recent V-Dem dataset, the dataset is **[freely available here](http://www.github.com/vdeminstitute/ert)**. We also provide the **ERT [R package](http://www.github.com/vdeminstitute/ert)** as a user-friendly tool to flexibly work with the dataset.

## Pandemic Backsliding

ThePandemic Backsliding project tracks state responses to Covid-19 and
their potential effect on the overall quality of democracy within the
country. The current version of the data reflects the situation between
March 2020 and June 2021. The data is **[freely available here](https://github.com/vdeminstitute/pandem)**, more information about the project [here](https://www.v-dem.net/pandem.html).

## Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem), Version 11.1.

I contributed to Version 11.1. of the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem)
dataset. The V-Dem dataset includes the world's most comprehensive and
detailed democracy ratings. The dataset and associated reference
documents are **[freely available here](https://www.v-dem.net/data/the-v-dem-dataset/).**

Together with a few colleagues, we put together the **vdemdata [R package](https://github.com/vdeminstitute/vdemdata)** as a user-friendly tool to work with the latest version of the V-Dem dataset.
